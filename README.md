# workday-scheduler
This application willl provide user with a basic calendar for working hours where the user can select a time to add their task and save it to the local storage.
The Calendar is color coded with different colors as per the time (past, present and future).
The past time is greyed out reminding users not to enter any task in the past time.
The current time is color coded with Red and Future times are in Green.
When the user clicks on a particular time, and enters a task, the save icon on the right needs to be cliked for actually saving the task.
If the Save button is not clicked, the task will show on the page, how ever it is not actually sotred in to the local storage and when the page is refreshed, the task does not appear on the page anymore.
